# COVID19_Analysis

## Project Overview:

This project analyzed COVID-19 data from Our World in Data, focusing on confirmed cases, deaths, vaccinations, and socio-economic indicators. Data was processed using SQL, and insights were visualized with a Tableau dashboard.

## Tools Used:

SQL: For data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): For database management and data exploration.
Tableau: To create interactive dashboards with key insights.
Excel: Initial data format for exploration.
Data Exploration: Using SQL, the dataset was structured into tables for confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccinations. Key metrics like total cases, deaths, and vaccination rates were analyzed. Comparative analyses, such as case-to-death ratios by country, were also conducted.

Tableau Dashboard: The dashboard visualizes:

Total cases, deaths, and vaccines administered
Trends by region over time
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for global COVID-19 impact.
Conclusion: This project provided valuable insights into COVID-19's impact by combining data analysis in SQL and dynamic visualizations in Tableau, offering a comprehensive overview of the pandemic's effects.
